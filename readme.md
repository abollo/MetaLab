# MetaLab

**MetaLab** is an open-source Python/C++ programming package for the inverse design of nanoscale optics devices by machine learning methods. By using powerful machine learning algorithms (deep neural network, [GBDT](https://github.com/closest-git/LiteMORT) ...),  MetaLab supports quick design of optical structures with high accuracy. The latest version could be accessed and downloaded from https://github.com/closest-git/MetaLab.

## Usage

#### 	Guided inverse design of surface plasmon polaritons

Prepare data and save results in the DATA_DIR. Then run the following command:

```python
    cd surface_plasmon
    python Net_sp_design_.py DATA_DIR
```

### Work with us

 Weâ€™re especially interested in hearing from and potentially working with those who are studying
- Inverse design of nanophotonic devices by machine learning methods
- Novel machine learning methods for inverse problems
